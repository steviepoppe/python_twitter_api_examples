# python_twitter_api_examples
Several python scripts using the Tweepy library to access Twitter's public APIs and aggregate Tweet JSON objects. Part of a brief [blog series](http://localhost:8000/blog/2020/04/a-quick-guide-to-data-mining-textual-analysis-of-japanese-twitter/) documenting some steps required to conduct a basic form of social media analysis on (Japanese) tweets from scratch.

**python_twitter_search.py**, **python_twitter_stream.py** and **python_twitter_timeline.py** are three scripts for accessing respectively the Twitter Search API, Stream API and User Timeline API.

Results are saved as raw JSON formatted objects and can be further processed to CSV files using **python_parse_tweet_ver2.py**

Further information on how to use can be found as comments within the python files, or on the above-linked blog article.
